### About me

I am a PhD student working in the field of deep learning, neural network compression and privacy preserving machine learning. I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (UoA) in 2016 with a specialization on Applied Mathematics. I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Thessaly (UTh) in 2017. Next I joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Purdue University as a PhD student under the guidance of Professor Kaushik Roy.
