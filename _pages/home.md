### About me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working in the field of Machine Learning. My research focuses on multimodal learning, efficient neural network deployment, computer vision and action recognition applications. I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (UoA) in 2016 with a specialization on Applied Mathematics. I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Thessaly (UTh) in 2017. Next, I joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Purdue University as a PhD student under the guidance of Professor Kaushik Roy.
